      <description>Mangal The Mangal project aims at archiving published ecological networks and at easing their retrieval. The database includes 172 datasets representing over 1300 ecological networks. This documentation is meant to describe all the the endpoints and parameters to developers who would like to use the Mangal RESTFul API.
Authentication Authentification is mandatory only for POST, PUT &amp;amp; DELETE operations. We used an OAuth 2.0 strategy to secure the Mangal API services exploiting ORCID as a third party authentification service.</description>
